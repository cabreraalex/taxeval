## Running this eval

1. Place your Anthropic, OpenAI, and Replicate API keys in your .env file, or in ~/.env.
2. Run `python main.py`.
3. `llm.py` contains some nice code for asking multiple LLMs several questions at once.
4. Visualize the results from all models with `visualize.ipynb`

## FAQ

Q: What about thinking step-by-step?

A: That's a good idea. This was a first test at zero-shot reasoning. I'm sure there are ways to improve it.

Q: How stable were the results?

A: This merits deeper investigation, but in the situations where everyone got the answer wrong, it is fairly unstable. It would be good to re-run the suite and test for that.

Q: Why didn't you zero the temperature?

A: I used the default settings for each model because I sort of assume that's the most fair test. If you have better ideas, please submit a PR!

Q: I am an accountant and I noticed horrific factual errors in the test suite.

A: Huh! I expected as much... please submit a pull request, thank you!
